# Existing Code Directory

This directory is for placing the existing academy tutor app code that was started by a novice developer.

## 📂 Instructions

1. **Place existing code here**: Copy all existing tutor app files into this directory
2. **Preserve structure**: Maintain the original folder structure for reference
3. **Review and analyze**: Use this code as reference for rebuilding the app
4. **Extract useful parts**: Identify reusable components, screens, and logic

## 🔄 Migration Process

### Step 1: Place Code
```bash
# Copy existing code to this directory
cp -r /path/to/existing/tutor-app/* ./existing-code/
```

### Step 2: Analyze Structure
- Review existing components and screens
- Identify useful UI patterns and navigation flows
- Extract business logic and data structures
- Note any working API integrations
- Assess role-based functionality implementation

### Step 3: Rebuild with Improvements
- Create new components in `../src/components/`
- Rebuild screens in `../src/screens/` with better UX
- Integrate with shared API client for consistency
- Apply academy design standards and patterns
- Implement proper TypeScript types
- Add comprehensive role-based access control

### Step 4: Test and Validate
- Ensure feature parity with existing app
- Improve code quality and performance
- Add proper error handling
- Write comprehensive tests
- Validate role-based permissions

## 🗂️ Expected Structure

After placing existing code, you might see:
```
existing-code/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── StudentCard/
│   │   ├── AttendanceForm/
│   │   ├── MessageComposer/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── screens/
│   │   ├── Dashboard/

```

### 🔍 Key Areas to Focus On

1. **Student Management**: How are students displayed and managed?
2. **Attendance System**: What's the flow for recording attendance?
3. **Communication**: How are messages composed and sent?
4. **Navigation**: What's the overall app navigation structure?
5. **Data Management**: How is data fetched, stored, and updated?

## 🚀 Improvement Opportunities

While analyzing, consider these improvements:

- **Better TypeScript**: Proper type definitions and interfaces
- **Improved UX**: More intuitive navigation and interactions
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering and data loading
- **Accessibility**: Better support for screen readers and accessibility
