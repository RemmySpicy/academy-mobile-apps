### 📊 Technical Implementation

#### Navigation Flow
```typescript
ProgressScreen -> CourseProgressCard.onPress() -> CourseCurriculumScreen
                                              -> LevelFilter.onPress()
                                              -> ModuleCard.onPress() 
                                              -> SectionTabs.onPress()
                                              -> LessonCard.onPress()
```

#### Data Structure
```typescript
interface CourseProgress {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
  currentLevel: number;
  totalLevels: number;
  overallProgress: number; // 0-100
  nextMilestone: string;
  isCompleted: boolean;
}

interface ProgressScreenData {
  courses: CourseProgress[];
  recentActivity: ActivityItem[];
  stats: {
    totalCourses: number;
    overallProgress: number;
    achievementsEarned: number;
    currentStreak: number;
  };
}
```

#### Progress Calculation Logic
```typescript
// Calculate overall course progress
const calculateCourseProgress = (curriculum: CourseCurriculum): number => {
  const totalLessons = curriculum.levels.reduce((total, level) => 
    total + level.modules.reduce((moduleTotal, module) =>
      moduleTotal + module.totalLessons, 0
    ), 0
  );
  
  const completedLessons = curriculum.levels.reduce((total, level) => 
    total + level.modules.reduce((moduleTotal, module) =>
      moduleTotal + module.completedLessons, 0
    ), 0
  );
  
  return Math.round((completedLessons / totalLessons) * 100);
};
```

#### Star Rating Component Integration
```typescript
const StarRating: React.FC<StarRatingProps> = ({ 
  starsEarned, 
  maxStars, 
  size = 12 
}) => {
  return (
    <View style={{ flexDirection: 'row', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      {Array.from({ length: maxStars }).map((_, index) => (
        <Ionicons
          key={index}
          name={index < starsEarned ? "star" : "star-outline"}
          size={size}
          color={index < starsEarned ? theme.colors.status.warning : theme.colors.text.tertiary}
        />
      ))}
    </View>
  );
};
```
