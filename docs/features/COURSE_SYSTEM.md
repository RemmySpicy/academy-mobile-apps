## Technical Implementation

### Course Data Structure
```typescript
interface CourseDetail {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
  longDescription: string;
  ageRange: string;
  courseLength: string; // e.g., "8 sessions over 4 weeks"
  sessionDuration: string; // e.g., "45 min"
  lessonTypes: LessonType[];
  locationOptions: LocationOption[];
  features: string[];
  totalEnrolled?: number;
  instructor?: InstructorProfile;
  // ... other properties
}
```

### Location Availability Logic
```typescript
const getLocationOptions = (courseId: string): LocationOption[] => {
  const locationAvailability: Record<string, { facility: boolean; preferred: boolean }> = {
    '1': { facility: true, preferred: true }, // Learn to Swim
    '2': { facility: true, preferred: false }, // Swimming Club
    // ... other courses
  };
  // Returns location options with availability flags
};
```

### Pricing Calculation
```typescript
// Private lessons typically cost 80% more
const privatePricing = basePricing.map(tier => ({
  ...tier,
  price: Math.round(tier.price * 1.8)
}));

// Semi-private lessons typically cost 40% more  
const semiPrivatePricing = basePricing.map(tier => ({
  ...tier,
  price: Math.round(tier.price * 1.4)
}));
```

## Course Card Updates

### Course List Display
Each course card now shows optimized information:
- **Age Range**: Target demographic (e.g., "5-17 years")

### Pricing Logic
```typescript
// All courses show "From" pricing since multiple lesson types exist
const displayPrice = `From ‚Ç¶${course.pricingTiers && course.pricingTiers.length > 0 ? 
  Math.min(...course.pricingTiers.map(t => t.price)).toLocaleString('en-NG') : 
  course.price.toLocaleString('en-NG')}`;
