## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { AchievementsScreen } from '../features/progress/screens/AchievementsScreen';
import { achievementsService, useProgramContext } from '@academy/mobile-shared';

// Access via navigation
navigation.navigate('Achievements');

// Program-aware achievements
const { currentProgram } = useProgramContext();
const achievements = achievementsService.generateMockAchievements(currentProgram);
const categories = achievementsService.generateMockCategories(currentProgram);
const sorted = achievementsService.sortAchievements(achievements, 'newest');
```

### Program-Specific Usage

```typescript
// Get program type information
const programType = achievementsService.getProgramType(currentProgram);
console.log(programType.categories); // ['Technique', 'Speed', 'Endurance', ...]
console.log(programType.colors.primary); // '#2563EB' for Swimming

// Generate program-specific data
const swimmingProgram = { id: '1', name: 'Swimming', /* ... */ };
const swimmingAchievements = achievementsService.generateMockAchievements(swimmingProgram);

const basketballProgram = { id: '2', name: 'Basketball', /* ... */ };
const basketballAchievements = achievementsService.generateMockAchievements(basketballProgram);
```

### Component Usage

```typescript
import { 
  AchievementCelebration,
  AchievementNotificationToast,
  AchievementLeaderboard 
} from '@academy/mobile-shared';

// Celebration on unlock
<AchievementCelebration
  celebration={celebrationData}
  onClose={() => setCelebration(null)}
